# learn-html
 Content is key. HTML is content.

 Github runs it's documentation, primarily, on markdown. This can include most _if not all_ standard html tags.

 <code>Like So</code>

 But markdown offers a few shortcuts, that really assist in the process

 ``` javascript
   function testMarkdownDisplay(){
       // And do some stuff
   }
 ```

We will get more in depth into that at a later time. For now, we will focus on the basics of HTML for Web Design, PDF design, and all the things.


## Boilerplate: 
### The bare minimum

Do not be concerned if you do not recognize or understand this. These following lines are the first leap of faith. They work. They are _mostly_ needed. Just use it and trust.
``` html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
    <head>
     <title></title>
    </head>

    <body>
     <!-- Commentary  -->
    </body>
   </html>
```

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr><th>Tag</th><th>description</th><th>example</th></tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr><td colspan='3'>Boilerplate: Syntax</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&lt;&gt;</td><td>An HTML element, is decalared with the brackets. <br>Most will be paired with a closing bracket <em>&lt;/&gt;</em></td><td></td></tr>
